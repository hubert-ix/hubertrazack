  <div class="description">
    Since having started my vocal training I have been fascinated by sacred music, and oratorios especially. My first exposure to choral music was the first movement of the St John's Passion by Bach - to this day one of my all-time favorite choral pieces. I wrote this mini-oratorio for a fundraiser concert and based it on text from the old and new testament.
