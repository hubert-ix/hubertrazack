    Since having started my vocal training I have been fascinated by sacred music, and oratorios especially. My first exposure to choral music was the first movement of the St John's Passion by Bach - to this day one of my all-time favorite choral pieces. I wrote this mini-oratorio for a fundraiser concert and based it on text from the old and new testament.

  <div class="lyrics">
    A new commandment I give unto you: that you love one another,<br />
    as I have loved you, that you also love one another<br /><br />

    For by grace are ye saved, through faith<br />
    And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God<br /><br />

    For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son<br />
    that whossoever believeth in him shall not perish<br />
    But have everlasting life<br /><br />

    For God sent not His son into the world to condemn the world,<br />
    But that through him the world might be saved<br /><br />

    For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels,<br />
    Nor principalities, nor power, nor things present, nor things to come,<br />
    Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creatures will be able to separate us from the love of God
