    This poem was written by Amber Earl, a young adult right in the midst of the pandemic. It explores what it felt like to have our life be seemingly on pause, and yet how to keep a spirit of optimism. The music reflects the transition from anxiety to confidence in the future.

        Stop,<br />
        The world you woke up in has changed<br />
        Hugs are not safe<br />
        It is ok if you are afraid<br /><br />
        
        Pause,<br />
        You are not who you used to be<br />
        You are evolving with this change<br />
        It is ok if you are reluctant<br /><br />
        
        Rest,<br />
        Your work will wait<br />
        The laundry is not important<br />
        It is ok if you are tired<br /><br />
        
        Cry,<br />
        Your grief is a real and necessary action<br />
        All your feelings are real<br />
        It is ok if you are angry<br /><br />
        
        Eat,<br />
        Your body needs energy the same way our world now does<br />
        You donâ€™t need restrictions<br />
        It is ok to be satisfied<br /><br />
        
        Create,<br />
        Greatness is in the doing<br />
        Find an outlet that feeds your soul<br />
        It is ok to try new things<br /><br />
        
        Dismantle,<br />
        Toss old items, old ideas, old behaviours<br />
        You do not need the baggage<br />
        It is ok be unencumbered<br /><br />
        
        Hope<br />
        You are powerless to change what the world is<br />
        But you are In charge of how you show up<br />
        It is ok to believe<br /><br />
        
        Wait<br />
        The world you woke up in has changed<br />
        Your job is to be still <br />
        In the end, it will be ok
