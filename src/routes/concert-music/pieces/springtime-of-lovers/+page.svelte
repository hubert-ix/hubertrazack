  <div class="description">
    An adpatation of a poem by Rumi, which reflects the mystical and symbolic language common in Sufi poetry. It encapsulates his central themes of love, transformation, and the search for the divine. I kept the music very straightforward, with only a slight twist at the end as <em>"the body becomes wholly soul"</em>.

        The springtime of Lovers has come,<br />
        that this dust bowl may become a garden;<br />
        the word of heaven has come,<br />
        that the bird of the soul may rise in flight.<br />
        the sea marsh becomes sweet as light,<br />
        the stone becomes a ruby from the mine,<br />
        the body becomes wholly soul.<br />
        For only from the heart can you touch the sky
