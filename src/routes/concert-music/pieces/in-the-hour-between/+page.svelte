    This beautiful poem by Canadian author Emiko Hsuen describes what occurs when a child goes through things they cannot understand, and how ultimately our ever-present inner child needs the embrace of a higher love. The music illustrates this transition from unsettling harmonies to beautiful and reassuring textures.

  <div class="lyrics">
    In the hour between the day and the night, everything changes.<br />
    Things I didn't know suddenly take shape and drew my attention.<br />
    Just a little darker, just a little bigger, just a little closer.<br />
    Boom, Kaboom!<br />
    Ah!<br /><br />
    Where am I? <br />
    It's a different world, such a different world!<br />
    Everything moves, everything breathes, everything's alive.<br />
    Without shape, just blurs and smudges and sweeps of unsafeness.<br />
    Ah!<br /><br />
    Hush... hush...<br />
    My child, come, in the warmth of mother's arms.<br />
    Everything changes.<br />
    Settling, soothing, comforting.<br />
    All is well.
