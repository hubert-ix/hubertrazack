  <div class="description">
    A beautiful text speaking of how important it is to recognise the limitation of perceptions, and how our world view can be transformed by something higher than us.

        Open my eyes, that I may see<br />
        Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me.<br />
        Place in my hands the wonderful key,<br />
        That shall unclasp and set me free.<br />
        <br />
        Open my ears, that I may hear<br />
        voices of truth Thou sendest clear;<br />
        and while the wave-notes fall on my ear,<br />
        everything false will disappear.<br />
        <br />
        Silently now I wait for Thee,<br />
        Ready, my God, Thy will to see.<br />
        Open my eyes, illumine me,<br />
        Spirit divine!<br />
