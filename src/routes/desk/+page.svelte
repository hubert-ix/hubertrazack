      <h2>Audio desk for sale in Toronto</h2>
    <p>This audio production desk was custom made by MGear Design (Hamilton). It's modelled after the Platform Desk by Output, but with a few unique tweaks.</p>
    <p>It has a keyboard tray large enough to hold a 88 key keyboard, with a cutout in the middle so that your legs fit easily while seating at the desk (I had it measured exactly). All with nice rounded corners!</p>
    <p>There are three 3U rack spaces for your gear, and everything is built with strong solid wood. Its greatest strength is the cable management solution, which I had designed very specifically. There are openings for cables all throughout the desk, and a huge cable tray at the back. No cables in sight!</p>
    <p>And I shall add: it's proudly 100% Canadian-made :) I hope it finds a good home and will keep serving musicians!</p>
